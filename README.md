# Climbing-Grade-Comparison
An idea i've had for a while based on a blogpost i saw ten years ago that ill try and link to, the idea is to create a site where anyone can come and add data points and view a master chart with options to include/exclude different information but the basic idea is to compare technical difficulty against resistance.
the first versions will be a simple python command line utility.
